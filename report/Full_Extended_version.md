## 1. üå± Introduction to the Problem

### 1.1 Biological Background

Stem cells represent one of the most fascinating areas of modern biology due to their unique properties:

| Property | Description | Impact |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| **üîÑ Self-renewal** | Ability to divide and produce identical copies | Maintains stem cell population |
| **üåü Pluripotency** | Capacity to differentiate into various specialized cell types | Enables tissue regeneration |
| **üíä Therapeutic potential** | Applications in regenerative medicine and disease treatment | Future medical breakthroughs |

The differentiation process is not random but follows carefully orchestrated molecular programs controlled by **transcription factors**‚Äîproteins that regulate gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences.

### 1.2 The PU.1-GATA-1 System

In hematopoietic (blood cell) development, two transcription factors play pivotal roles:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Stem Cell] --> B{PU.1 vs GATA-1}
    B -->|PU.1 dominates| C[Myeloid Lineage]
    B -->|GATA-1 dominates| D[Erythroid Lineage]
    C --> E[White Blood Cells<br/>‚Ä¢ Neutrophils<br/>‚Ä¢ Macrophages]
    D --> F[Red Blood Cells<br/>‚Ä¢ Erythrocytes<br/>‚Ä¢ Megakaryocytes]
```

**üî¥ PU.1**: Promotes myeloid lineage (white blood cells like neutrophils, macrophages)  
**üü° GATA-1**: Promotes erythroid lineage (red blood cells and megakaryocytes)

These factors exhibit a fascinating biological phenomenon called **mutual inhibition**‚Äîwhen one is highly expressed, it suppresses the other. This creates a "toggle switch" mechanism that ensures cells commit to one specific fate.

### 1.3 Mathematical Modeling Approach

Our mathematical framework consists of:

- üìê **System of coupled nonlinear ODEs**
- üìä **Two dependent variables**: PU.1 and GATA-1 concentrations
- ‚è∞ **Time as independent variable**
- üî¨ **Multiple solution approaches**: Numerical and ML methods

**Why Mathematical Modeling?**
- ‚úÖ Predict gene expression changes over time
- ‚úÖ Understand conditions favoring different cell fates
- ‚úÖ Test hypotheses about regulatory mechanisms
- ‚úÖ Design potential therapeutic interventions

The system describing PU.1-GATA-1 interaction:

```mathematica
d[G]/dt = (a‚ÇÅ[G]‚Åø)/(Œ∏‚Çê‚ÇÅ‚Åø + [G]‚Åø) + (b‚ÇÅŒ∏·µ¶‚ÇÅ·µê)/(Œ∏·µ¶‚ÇÅ·µê + [G]·µê[P]·µê) - k‚ÇÅ[G]   (1a)

d[P]/dt = (a‚ÇÇ[P]‚Åø)/(Œ∏‚Çê‚ÇÇ‚Åø + [P]‚Åø) + (b‚ÇÇŒ∏·µ¶‚ÇÇ·µê)/(Œ∏·µ¶‚ÇÇ·µê + [G]·µê[P]·µê) - k‚ÇÇ[P]   (1b)
```

# 4. Numerical Methods Implementation

## 4.1 deSolve Package Implementation (Baseline)

### 4.1.1 Method Overview

The `deSolve` package in R provides robust ODE solvers, particularly `lsodes` (Livermore Solver for Ordinary Differential Equations with Sparse matrices). This solver is specifically designed for **stiff systems** - a critical characteristic of our stem cell differentiation model.

**What makes a system stiff?**
- **Multiple time scales**: Some variables change rapidly (fast transients), others slowly (equilibrium approach)
- **Large eigenvalue ratios** in the Jacobian matrix (ratios > 10¬≥)
- **Explicit methods require impractically small time steps** for numerical stability

### 4.1.2 Backward Differentiation Formulas (BDF)

The `lsodes` solver employs BDF methods, which are implicit multistep methods:

```
y‚Çô - Œ±‚ÇÅy‚Çô‚Çã‚ÇÅ - Œ±‚ÇÇy‚Çô‚Çã‚ÇÇ - ... = Œît √ó Œ≤f(t‚Çô, y‚Çô)
```

For the simplest case (BDF-1, backward Euler):
```
y‚Çô - y‚Çô‚Çã‚ÇÅ = Œît √ó f(t‚Çô, y‚Çô)
```

**Key Advantages of Implicit Methods:**
- **A-stability**: Unconditionally stable for linear problems
- **Large step sizes**: Can handle stiff dynamics without numerical instability
- **Error control**: Built-in adaptive step size based on local truncation error
- **Robustness**: Handles both smooth and rapidly changing solutions

### 4.1.3 Implementation Details

```r
# System definition for stem cell model
stem_1 <- function(t, state, parameters) {
  with(as.list(c(state, parameters)), {
    # Calculate derivatives according to equations (1a) and (1b)
    dG <- (a1 * G^n)/(theta_a1^n + G^n) + 
          (b1 * theta_b1^m)/(theta_b1^m + G^m * P^m) - k1 * G
    dP <- (a2 * P^n)/(theta_a2^n + P^n) + 
          (b2 * theta_b2^m)/(theta_b2^m + G^m * P^m) - k2 * P
    
    return(list(c(dG, dP)))
  })
}

# Solve with automatic method selection
result <- lsodes(y = initial_conditions, 
                times = time_sequence, 
                func = stem_1, 
                parms = parameters)
```

### 4.1.4 Performance Analysis

Our baseline implementation reveals distinct behavioral regimes:

**Case 1: Near-Equilibrium Dynamics (a‚ÇÅ=1, a‚ÇÇ=1)**
- Rapid convergence to stable steady state
- Minimal function evaluations (89 calls)
- Represents dormant/quiescent progenitor state
- Low computational overhead due to minimal stiffness

**Case 2: Nonlinear Transient Behavior (a‚ÇÅ=5, a‚ÇÇ=10)**
- Complex initial rapid growth phase
- Gradual saturation to new equilibrium
- Higher function evaluations (192 calls)
- Represents active differentiation with stronger regulatory feedback

---

## 4.2 Trapezoidal Method Implementation

### 4.2.1 Method Derivation and Theory

The trapezoidal rule represents a significant improvement over simple Euler methods by achieving **second-order accuracy** through geometric averaging of derivatives.

**Evolution from Euler's Method:**
```
Euler (1st order):     y‚Çô‚Çä‚ÇÅ = y‚Çô + h √ó f(t‚Çô, y‚Çô)
Trapezoidal (2nd order): y‚Çô‚Çä‚ÇÅ = y‚Çô + (h/2) √ó [f(t‚Çô, y‚Çô) + f(t‚Çô‚Çä‚ÇÅ, y‚Çô‚Çä‚ÇÅ)]
```

**Geometric Interpretation**: Instead of using the slope at just one point, the trapezoidal method averages the slopes at both endpoints, providing a more accurate approximation of the area under the curve.

### 4.2.2 Implicit Solution Strategy

Since y‚Çô‚Çä‚ÇÅ appears on both sides of the equation, we implement a **fixed-point iteration scheme**:

```python
def trapezoidal_step(t_n, y_n, h, f, params, tol=1e-6, max_iter=100):
    # Initial predictor using Euler's method
    f_n = f(t_n, y_n, params)
    y_guess = y_n + h * f_n
    
    # Fixed-point iteration
    for iteration in range(max_iter):
        f_guess = f(t_n + h, y_guess, params)
        y_next = y_n + (h/2) * (f_n + f_guess)
        
        # Convergence check
        if norm(y_next - y_guess) < tol:
            return y_next, iteration + 1
        y_guess = y_next
    
    return y_next, max_iter
```

### 4.2.3 Implementation Analysis

**Computational Characteristics:**
- **Step size**: h = 0.2 (optimized for accuracy-efficiency balance)
- **Convergence tolerance**: 10‚Åª‚Å∂ (ensures 6-digit precision)
- **Iteration limit**: 100 per time step (prevents infinite loops)

**Performance Results from Implementation:**
- **Case 1**: Fast convergence (1-3 iterations per step typical)
- **Case 2**: Moderate convergence (2-5 iterations per step due to nonlinearity)
- **Total iterations**: Tracked globally to assess computational cost

### 4.2.4 Stability and Accuracy Properties

**A-Stability**: The trapezoidal method is A-stable, meaning it remains stable for any step size when applied to linear systems with eigenvalues in the left half-plane.

**For our nonlinear system**: The method demonstrates excellent stability for moderate stiffness, handling the rapid changes in the activation functions without requiring excessively small time steps.

## 4.3 Custom Radau IIA Method Implementation

### 4.3.1 Why Radau for Biological Systems?

The Radau IIA method excels in biological modeling due to its **L-stability** properties:

- **A-stability**: Handles all stable eigenvalues
- **L-stability**: Superior damping of high-frequency oscillations
- **Order 5 accuracy**: High precision with reasonable computational cost
- **Stiff-stable**: Optimal for systems with multiple time scales

### 4.3.2 Mathematical Formulation

**Three-Stage Radau IIA Butcher Tableau:**

The method uses carefully chosen coefficients derived from Gaussian quadrature:

```python
# Radau IIA coefficients (optimized for stiff problems)
c = [(4 - ‚àö6)/10, (4 + ‚àö6)/10, 1.0]

A = [[( 88 - 7‚àö6)/360,  (296 - 169‚àö6)/1800, (-2 + 3‚àö6)/225],
     [(296 + 169‚àö6)/1800, ( 88 + 7‚àö6)/360,   (-2 - 3‚àö6)/225],
     [( 16 - ‚àö6)/36,      ( 16 + ‚àö6)/36,      1/9]]

b = [(16 - ‚àö6)/36, (16 + ‚àö6)/36, 1/9]
```

### 4.3.3 Newton-Raphson Implementation

The implicit nature requires solving a coupled nonlinear system at each step:

```python
def radau_step(self, f, jac, t, y, h, params):
    # Initialize stage values
    Y = [y.copy() for _ in range(3)]
    
    # Newton iteration for implicit stages
    for iteration in range(self.max_iter):
        # Build residual vector R(Y)
        R = self.compute_residual(Y, y, h, f, t, params)
        
        # Check convergence
        if max_norm(R) < tolerance:
            break
            
        # Construct and solve Newton system
        J = self.build_jacobian_system(Y, h, jac, t, params)
        delta = solve_linear_system(J, -R)
        
        # Update stage values
        Y += delta.reshape_stages()
    
    # Compute final solution
    return self.final_update(Y, h, f, t, params)
```

### 4.3.4 Adaptive Step Control

**Error Estimation Strategy:**
```python
# Embedded method for error control
error = norm(y_new_5th_order - y_new_4th_order)
error_relative = error / max(1.0, norm(y))

# PI controller for step adaptation
if error_relative <= tolerance:
    h_new = h * min(5.0, 0.9 * (tolerance/error_relative)^(1/5))
else:
    h_new = h * max(0.2, 0.9 * (tolerance/error_relative)^(1/5))
```

### 4.3.5 Performance Analysis from Implementation

**Computational Efficiency:**
- **Higher cost per step** due to Newton iterations and Jacobian evaluations
- **Larger stable step sizes** compensate for per-step overhead
- **Adaptive control** optimizes step size for local solution behavior

**Case Study Results:**
- **Case 1**: Efficient handling of near-equilibrium dynamics
- **Case 2**: Superior performance on stiff transient behavior
- **Function calls**: Counted globally including Jacobian evaluations

**Memory and Complexity:**
- **3√ó3 linear systems** per Newton iteration
- **Jacobian computation**: Analytical derivatives for efficiency
- **Convergence monitoring**: Typically 3-7 Newton iterations per step
