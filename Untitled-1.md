# Stem Cell Differentiation: Numerical and Machine Learning Methods for Differential Equations in Biomedical Engineering

## Abstract

This project explores the modeling of gene regulatory networks involved in stem cell differentiation through a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) describing the interaction between the transcription factors PU.1 and GATA-1. To solve this system, two numerical approaches—the trapezoidal rule and Radau method—are used to capture the system's dynamics with stability and precision. Additionally, a machine learning model based on Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) is implemented using PyTorch to provide a data-driven solution framework that embeds the ODE structure directly into the learning process. By comparing the numerical and machine learning results, we assess the strengths and limitations of each approach. The numerical methods demonstrate higher accuracy and computational efficiency, while the PINNs model shows potential in learning system behavior from limited data. This comparative study highlights the complementary nature of traditional solvers and neural ODE models, offering insight into future hybrid methods for modeling biological systems.

## 1. Introduction to the Problem

### 1.1 Biological Background

Stem cells represent one of the most fascinating areas of modern biology due to their unique properties:

- **Self-renewal**: The ability to divide and produce identical copies of themselves
- **Pluripotency**: The capacity to differentiate into various specialized cell types
- **Therapeutic potential**: Applications in regenerative medicine and disease treatment

The differentiation process is not random but follows carefully orchestrated molecular programs controlled by transcription factors—proteins that regulate gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences.

### 1.2 The PU.1-GATA-1 System

In hematopoietic (blood cell) development, two transcription factors play pivotal roles:

- **PU.1**: Promotes myeloid lineage (white blood cells like neutrophils, macrophages)
- **GATA-1**: Promotes erythroid lineage (red blood cells and megakaryocytes)

These factors exhibit a fascinating biological phenomenon called **mutual inhibition**—when one is highly expressed, it suppresses the other. This creates a "toggle switch" mechanism that ensures cells commit to one specific fate rather than attempting to become multiple cell types simultaneously.

### 1.3 Mathematical Modeling Approach

To understand this complex biological system, we employ a mathematical model consisting of:
- A system of coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs)
- Two dependent variables: concentrations of PU.1 and GATA-1
- Time as the independent variable
- Multiple numerical and machine learning solution approaches

This mathematical framework allows us to:
- Predict how gene expression changes over time
- Understand the conditions that favor different cell fates
- Test hypotheses about regulatory mechanisms
- Design potential therapeutic interventions

## 2. Literature Review

### 2.1 Mathematical Modeling in Biology

Mathematical modeling using ODEs has become an indispensable tool in systems biology, particularly for understanding gene regulatory networks. The power of these models lies in their ability to:

- **Capture nonlinear dynamics**: Biological systems often exhibit threshold effects, feedback loops, and bistability
- **Integrate multiple interactions**: Account for self-regulation, mutual inhibition, and external signals
- **Make quantitative predictions**: Move beyond qualitative descriptions to precise forecasts

### 2.2 The PU.1-GATA-1 Model Development

The foundational work by Duff et al. (2012) established the mathematical framework we use in this study. Their model incorporates several key biological features:

- **Bistability**: The system can exist in two stable states corresponding to different cell fates
- **Hysteresis**: The path of differentiation depends on the starting conditions and history
- **Robustness**: Small perturbations don't easily shift the system between states

### 2.3 Numerical Methods for Biological ODEs

Traditional numerical approaches for solving biological ODEs include:

- **Explicit methods** (e.g., Runge-Kutta): Fast but potentially unstable for stiff systems
- **Implicit methods** (e.g., Backward Euler, BDF): More stable but computationally expensive
- **Adaptive methods**: Automatically adjust step size based on solution behavior

The challenge in biological systems often comes from **stiffness**—when the system contains both fast and slow dynamics, requiring very small time steps for stability.

### 2.4 Machine Learning Approaches: Physics-Informed Neural Networks

Recent advances in machine learning have introduced Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), which offer several advantages:

- **Data efficiency**: Can learn from limited experimental data
- **Physics constraints**: Ensure solutions obey known physical laws
- **Continuous solutions**: Provide smooth, differentiable approximations
- **Uncertainty quantification**: Can estimate confidence in predictions

However, PINNs also face challenges:
- **Computational cost**: Training can be expensive compared to traditional solvers
- **Convergence issues**: Complex loss landscapes can make optimization difficult
- **Parameter sensitivity**: Performance highly dependent on hyperparameter choices

## 3. ODE Model Explanation

### 3.1 Mathematical Formulation

The system of ODEs describing the PU.1-GATA-1 interaction is:

```
d[G]/dt = (a₁[G]ⁿ)/(θₐ₁ⁿ + [G]ⁿ) + (b₁θᵦ₁ᵐ)/(θᵦ₁ᵐ + [G]ᵐ[P]ᵐ) - k₁[G]   (1a)

d[P]/dt = (a₂[P]ⁿ)/(θₐ₂ⁿ + [P]ⁿ) + (b₂θᵦ₂ᵐ)/(θᵦ₂ᵐ + [G]ᵐ[P]ᵐ) - k₂[P]   (1b)
```

### 3.2 Variables and Parameters

**Variables:**
- `[G]`: Normalized expression level of GATA-1
- `[P]`: Normalized expression level of PU.1  
- `t`: Time

**Parameters:**
- `a₁, a₂`: Self-activation rates (how strongly each gene promotes itself)
- `b₁, b₂`: External regulation coefficients
- `θₐ₁, θₐ₂, θᵦ₁, θᵦ₂`: Threshold parameters for activation/inhibition
- `k₁, k₂`: Degradation rates (natural decay of proteins)
- `n, m`: Hill coefficients (determine steepness of regulatory responses)

### 3.3 Biological Interpretation of Each Term

#### Term 1: Self-Activation
```
(aᵢ[X]ⁿ)/(θₐᵢⁿ + [X]ⁿ)
```

This Hill function models **positive feedback**:
- When gene expression is low, self-activation is weak
- Once expression crosses a threshold, it rapidly increases its own production
- The Hill coefficient `n` determines how sharp this transition is
- **Biological significance**: Creates commitment to a cell fate—once started, the process accelerates

#### Term 2: Mutual Inhibition
```
(bᵢθᵦᵢᵐ)/(θᵦᵢᵐ + [G]ᵐ[P]ᵐ)
```

This term captures **negative feedback** between the two genes:
- High levels of both genes together reduce the activation
- When one gene dominates, it suppresses the other
- **Biological significance**: Ensures mutually exclusive cell fates—cells become either erythroid OR myeloid, not both

#### Term 3: Degradation
```
-kᵢ[X]
```

Simple linear decay:
- Proteins are constantly being degraded by cellular machinery
- Without active production, expression levels return to zero
- **Biological significance**: Provides stability and allows for dynamic responses to changing conditions

### 3.4 Parameter Cases Studied

#### Case 1: Symmetric Activation (a₁ = 1, a₂ = 1)
- **Biological context**: Represents a balanced progenitor state
- **Expected behavior**: Bistable system with equal preference for both fates
- **Clinical relevance**: Models healthy stem cell populations

#### Case 2: Asymmetric Activation (a₁ = 5, a₂ = 10)
- **Biological context**: PU.1 has stronger self-activation than GATA-1
- **Expected behavior**: System biased toward myeloid differentiation
- **Clinical relevance**: Models conditions where myeloid development is favored (e.g., certain leukemias)

### 3.5 System Properties

#### Multistability
The nonlinear structure creates multiple stable equilibria:
- **Low-low state**: Both genes weakly expressed (progenitor state)
- **High G, low P**: GATA-1 dominates (erythroid fate)
- **Low G, high P**: PU.1 dominates (myeloid fate)

#### Dynamical Behavior
- **Basin of attraction**: Initial conditions determine final fate
- **Switching dynamics**: Rare transitions between stable states
- **Noise sensitivity**: Random fluctuations can influence fate decisions

## 4. Numerical Methods Implementation

### 4.1 deSolve Package Implementation (Baseline)

#### 4.1.1 Method Overview

The `deSolve` package in R provides robust ODE solvers, particularly `lsodes` (Livermore Solver for Ordinary Differential Equations with Sparse matrices). This solver is specifically designed for **stiff systems**.

**What makes a system stiff?**
- Multiple time scales: Some variables change rapidly, others slowly
- Large eigenvalue ratios in the Jacobian matrix
- Explicit methods require impractically small time steps for stability

#### 4.1.2 Backward Differentiation Formulas (BDF)

The `lsodes` solver uses BDF methods, which are implicit:

```
yₙ - yₙ₋₁ = Δt × f(tₙ, yₙ)
```

**Advantages of implicit methods:**
- **Stability**: Can use larger time steps without numerical instability
- **Accuracy**: Better handling of stiff dynamics
- **Adaptivity**: Automatic step size control based on error estimates

#### 4.1.3 Implementation Details

```r
# System definition
stem_1 <- function(t, state, parameters) {
  with(as.list(c(state, parameters)), {
    # Calculate derivatives according to equations (1a) and (1b)
    dG <- (a1 * G^n)/(theta_a1^n + G^n) + 
          (b1 * theta_b1^m)/(theta_b1^m + G^m * P^m) - k1 * G
    dP <- (a2 * P^n)/(theta_a2^n + P^n) + 
          (b2 * theta_b2^m)/(theta_b2^m + G^m * P^m) - k2 * P
    
    return(list(c(dG, dP)))
  })
}

# Solve system
result <- lsodes(y = initial_conditions, 
                times = time_sequence, 
                func = stem_1, 
                parms = parameters)
```

#### 4.1.4 Results Analysis

**Case 1: Near-Equilibrium Dynamics**
- Rapid convergence to stable state
- Minimal function calls (89)
- Represents dormant or balanced progenitor state

**Case 2: Nonlinear Transient Behavior**
- Initial rapid growth phase
- Gradual saturation to new equilibrium
- More function calls (192) due to complex dynamics
- Represents active differentiation process

### 4.2 Trapezoidal Method Implementation

#### 4.2.1 Method Derivation

The trapezoidal rule improves upon Euler's method by using the average of slopes at both ends of the interval:

**Euler's Method (First-order):**
```
yₙ₊₁ = yₙ + h × f(tₙ, yₙ)
```

**Trapezoidal Method (Second-order):**
```
yₙ₊₁ = yₙ + (h/2) × [f(tₙ, yₙ) + f(tₙ₊₁, yₙ₊₁)]
```

#### 4.2.2 Implicit Nature and Fixed-Point Iteration

Since `yₙ₊₁` appears on both sides, we need an iterative approach:

1. **Initial guess**: Use Euler's method for first approximation
   ```
   y⁽⁰⁾ₙ₊₁ = yₙ + h × f(tₙ, yₙ)
   ```

2. **Iteration**: Refine the estimate
   ```
   y⁽ᵏ⁺¹⁾ₙ₊₁ = yₙ + (h/2) × [f(tₙ, yₙ) + f(tₙ₊₁, y⁽ᵏ⁾ₙ₊₁)]
   ```

3. **Convergence check**: Continue until
   ```
   ||y⁽ᵏ⁺¹⁾ₙ₊₁ - y⁽ᵏ⁾ₙ₊₁|| < tolerance
   ```

#### 4.2.3 Implementation Parameters

- **Time step**: h = 0.2 (chosen to balance accuracy and efficiency)
- **Tolerance**: 10⁻⁶ (ensures sufficient precision)
- **Maximum iterations**: 100 per time step (prevents infinite loops)

#### 4.2.4 Performance Analysis

**Computational Efficiency:**
- More function evaluations than explicit methods
- Fewer evaluations than higher-order implicit methods
- Good compromise between accuracy and speed

**Stability Properties:**
- A-stable (unconditionally stable for linear problems)
- Better stability than explicit methods for our nonlinear system
- Can handle moderate stiffness

### 4.3 Radau Method Implementation

#### 4.3.1 Why Radau for Stiff Systems?

The Radau IIA method is particularly well-suited for stiff ODEs because it possesses **L-stability**:
- **A-stability**: Stable for all step sizes in the left half-plane
- **L-stability**: Damping at infinity (handles very stiff components)
- **High order**: Fifth-order accuracy with three stages

#### 4.3.2 Radau IIA Formulation

The method uses three stages with specific coefficients from the Butcher tableau:

```
Stage equations:
Y₁ = yₙ + h × Σ(a₁ⱼ × f(tₙ + cⱼh, Yⱼ))
Y₂ = yₙ + h × Σ(a₂ⱼ × f(tₙ + cⱼh, Yⱼ))  
Y₃ = yₙ + h × Σ(a₃ⱼ × f(tₙ + cⱼh, Yⱼ))

Final update:
yₙ₊₁ = yₙ + h × Σ(bⱼ × f(tₙ + cⱼh, Yⱼ))
```

#### 4.3.3 Newton-Raphson Solution

Since the stages are coupled, we solve the nonlinear system using Newton's method:

1. **Linearization**: Compute Jacobian matrix
2. **Linear solve**: Find correction vector
3. **Update**: Apply correction to stage values
4. **Iterate**: Until convergence

#### 4.3.4 Adaptive Step Size Control

The method includes error estimation and step size adaptation:

```
Error estimate: ||yₙ₊₁⁽⁵⁾ - yₙ₊₁⁽⁴⁾||

New step size: hₙₑw = h × (tolerance/error)^(1/5)
```

#### 4.3.5 Performance Characteristics

**Advantages:**
- Excellent stability for stiff problems
- High accuracy (fifth-order)
- Robust error control
- Proven performance on biological systems

**Computational Cost:**
- Higher cost per step due to Newton iterations
- Offset by ability to take larger steps
- Most efficient for truly stiff problems

## 5. Machine Learning Implementation: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)

### 5.1 PINN Fundamentals

#### 5.1.1 Core Philosophy

Traditional numerical methods discretize the domain and solve for values at grid points. PINNs take a fundamentally different approach:

- **Continuous representation**: Neural networks naturally provide continuous functions
- **Physics embedding**: Differential equations become part of the loss function
- **Data-driven**: Can incorporate experimental observations
- **Differentiable**: Automatic differentiation for computing derivatives

#### 5.1.2 PINN Architecture for ODE Systems

For our stem cell system, the neural network:

**Input:** Time t (1 dimension)
**Output:** [G(t), P(t)] (2 dimensions)

The network learns to approximate the solution functions G(t) and P(t) directly.

### 5.2 Loss Function Design

#### 5.2.1 Multi-Objective Loss

The total loss combines multiple objectives:

```
L_total = w_physics × L_physics + w_initial × L_initial
```

Where:
- `L_physics`: Ensures the ODE is satisfied
- `L_initial`: Enforces initial conditions
- `w_physics, w_initial`: Adaptive weights

#### 5.2.2 Physics Loss Computation

For each collocation point t_i:

1. **Forward pass**: Compute G(t_i) and P(t_i)
2. **Automatic differentiation**: Compute dG/dt and dP/dt
3. **Residual calculation**:

$R_G = \frac{dG}{dt} - \left[\frac{a_1G^n}{\theta_{a1}^n + G^n} + \frac{b_1\theta_{b1}^m}{\theta_{b1}^m + G^mP^m} - k_1G\right]$

$R_P = \frac{dP}{dt} - \left[\frac{a_2P^n}{\theta_{a2}^n + P^n} + \frac{b_2\theta_{b2}^m}{\theta_{b2}^m + G^mP^m} - k_2P\right]$


4. **Physics loss**: `L_physics = mean(R_G² + R_P²)`

#### 5.2.3 Initial Condition Loss

```
L_initial = (G(0) - G₀)² + (P(0) - P₀)²
```

Where G₀ and P₀ are the specified initial conditions.

- Case 1: MAE_G = 0.0031, MAE_P = 0.0028
- Case 2: MAE_G = 0.0089, MAE_P = 0.0076

#### 5.5.2 Computational Efficiency Comparison

| Method | Case 1 Time | Case 2 Time | Speedup Factor |
|--------|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| Numerical | 0.023s | 0.031s | 1.0 (baseline) |
| PINNs | 847.3s | 1,534.8s | 0.000027 |

**Analysis:**
- PINNs are ~37,000× slower for this problem size
- However, once trained, evaluation at any point is instantaneous
- For problems requiring many forward solves, amortized cost may favor PINNs
