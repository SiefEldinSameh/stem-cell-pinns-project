## 1. 🌱 Introduction to the Problem

### 1.1 Biological Background

Stem cells represent one of the most fascinating areas of modern biology due to their unique properties:

| Property | Description | Impact |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| **🔄 Self-renewal** | Ability to divide and produce identical copies | Maintains stem cell population |
| **🌟 Pluripotency** | Capacity to differentiate into various specialized cell types | Enables tissue regeneration |
| **💊 Therapeutic potential** | Applications in regenerative medicine and disease treatment | Future medical breakthroughs |

The differentiation process is not random but follows carefully orchestrated molecular programs controlled by **transcription factors**—proteins that regulate gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences.

### 1.2 The PU.1-GATA-1 System

In hematopoietic (blood cell) development, two transcription factors play pivotal roles:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Stem Cell] --> B{PU.1 vs GATA-1}
    B -->|PU.1 dominates| C[Myeloid Lineage]
    B -->|GATA-1 dominates| D[Erythroid Lineage]
    C --> E[White Blood Cells<br/>• Neutrophils<br/>• Macrophages]
    D --> F[Red Blood Cells<br/>• Erythrocytes<br/>• Megakaryocytes]
```

**🔴 PU.1**: Promotes myeloid lineage (white blood cells like neutrophils, macrophages)  
**🟡 GATA-1**: Promotes erythroid lineage (red blood cells and megakaryocytes)

These factors exhibit a fascinating biological phenomenon called **mutual inhibition**—when one is highly expressed, it suppresses the other. This creates a "toggle switch" mechanism that ensures cells commit to one specific fate.

### 1.3 Mathematical Modeling Approach

Our mathematical framework consists of:

- 📐 **System of coupled nonlinear ODEs**
- 📊 **Two dependent variables**: PU.1 and GATA-1 concentrations

## 3. 🧮 ODE Model Explanation

### 3.1 Mathematical Formulation

The system describing PU.1-GATA-1 interaction:

```mathematica
d[G]/dt = (a₁[G]ⁿ)/(θₐ₁ⁿ + [G]ⁿ) + (b₁θᵦ₁ᵐ)/(θᵦ₁ᵐ + [G]ᵐ[P]ᵐ) - k₁[G]   (1a)

d[P]/dt = (a₂[P]ⁿ)/(θₐ₂ⁿ + [P]ⁿ) + (b₂θᵦ₂ᵐ)/(θᵦ₂ᵐ + [G]ᵐ[P]ᵐ) - k₂[P]   (1b)
```

### 3.2 Variables and Parameters

#### **🔬 Variables:**
| Symbol | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `[G]` | Normalized GATA-1 expression level |
| `[P]` | Normalized PU.1 expression level |
| `t` | Time |

#### **⚙️ Parameters:**
| Parameter | Description | Biological Role |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| `a₁, a₂` | Self-activation rates | Gene self-promotion strength |
| `b₁, b₂` | External regulation coefficients | Outside influence |
| `θₐ₁, θₐ₂, θᵦ₁, θᵦ₂` | Threshold parameters | Activation/inhibition thresholds |
| `k₁, k₂` | Degradation rates | Natural protein decay |
| `n, m` | Hill coefficients | Regulatory response steepness |

### 3.3 Biological Interpretation of Each Term

#### **🔄 Term 1: Self-Activation**
```mathematica
(aᵢ[X]ⁿ)/(θₐᵢⁿ + [X]ⁿ)
```

**Hill function modeling positive feedback:**
- 📉 Low expression → weak self-activation
- 📈 Threshold crossing → rapid self-production increase
- 🎯 Hill coefficient `n` → transition sharpness
- 🧬 **Biology**: Creates cell fate commitment—acceleration once started

#### **⚔️ Term 2: Mutual Inhibition**
```mathematica
(bᵢθᵦᵢᵐ)/(θᵦᵢᵐ + [G]ᵐ[P]ᵐ)
```

**Negative feedback between genes:**
- 🔴 High both genes → reduced activation
- ⚖️ One dominates → suppresses the other
- 🧬 **Biology**: Ensures mutually exclusive fates—erythroid OR myeloid, not both

#### **💀 Term 3: Degradation**
```mathematica
-kᵢ[X]
```

**Simple linear decay:**
- 🔄 Constant protein degradation by cellular machinery
- 📉 Without production → expression returns to zero
- 🧬 **Biology**: Provides stability and dynamic response capability

### 3.4 Parameter Cases Studied

#### **🟢 Case 1: Symmetric Activation** `(a₁ = 1, a₂ = 1)`
- **🧬 Context**: Balanced progenitor state
- **📊 Behavior**: Bistable system, equal fate preference
- **🏥 Relevance**: Healthy stem cell populations

#### **🔵 Case 2: Asymmetric Activation** `(a₁ = 5, a₂ = 10)`
- **🧬 Context**: PU.1 stronger self-activation than GATA-1
- **📊 Behavior**: System biased toward myeloid differentiation
- **🏥 Relevance**: Myeloid-favored conditions (certain leukemias)

### 3.5 System Properties

#### **🔀 Multistability**
Multiple stable equilibria:

```
📍 Low-low state: Both genes weakly expressed (progenitor)
📍 High G, low P: GATA-1 dominates (erythroid fate)
📍 Low G, high P: PU.1 dominates (myeloid fate)
```

#### **⚡ Dynamical Behavior**
- **🎯 Basin of attraction**: Initial conditions → final fate
- **🔄 Switching dynamics**: Rare transitions between stable states
- **🎲 Noise sensitivity**: Random fluctuations influence fate decisions

## 4. Numerical Methods Implementation

### 4.1 deSolve Package Implementation (Baseline)

#### 4.1.1 Method Overview

The `deSolve` package in R provides robust ODE solvers, particularly `lsodes` (Livermore Solver for Ordinary Differential Equations with Sparse matrices). This solver is specifically designed for **stiff systems**.

**What makes a system stiff?**
- Multiple time scales: Some variables change rapidly, others slowly
- Large eigenvalue ratios in the Jacobian matrix
- Explicit methods require impractically small time steps for stability

#### 4.1.2 Backward Differentiation Formulas (BDF)

The `lsodes` solver uses BDF methods, which are implicit:

```
yₙ - yₙ₋₁ = Δt × f(tₙ, yₙ)
```

**Advantages of implicit methods:**
- **Stability**: Can use larger time steps without numerical instability
- **Accuracy**: Better handling of stiff dynamics
- **Adaptivity**: Automatic step size control based on error estimates

#### 4.1.3 Implementation Details

```r
# System definition
stem_1 <- function(t, state, parameters) {
  with(as.list(c(state, parameters)), {
    # Calculate derivatives according to equations (1a) and (1b)
    dG <- (a1 * G^n)/(theta_a1^n + G^n) + 
          (b1 * theta_b1^m)/(theta_b1^m + G^m * P^m) - k1 * G
    dP <- (a2 * P^n)/(theta_a2^n + P^n) + 
          (b2 * theta_b2^m)/(theta_b2^m + G^m * P^m) - k2 * P
    
    return(list(c(dG, dP)))
  })
}

# Solve system
result <- lsodes(y = initial_conditions, 
                times = time_sequence, 
                func = stem_1, 
                parms = parameters)
```

#### 4.1.4 Results Analysis

**Case 1: Near-Equilibrium Dynamics**
- Rapid convergence to stable state
- Minimal function calls (89)
- Represents dormant or balanced progenitor state

**Case 2: Nonlinear Transient Behavior**
- Initial rapid growth phase
- Gradual saturation to new equilibrium
- More function calls (192) due to complex dynamics
- Represents active differentiation process

### 4.2 Trapezoidal Method Implementation

#### 4.2.1 Method Derivation

The trapezoidal rule improves upon Euler's method by using the average of slopes at both ends of the interval:

**Euler's Method (First-order):**
```
yₙ₊₁ = yₙ + h × f(tₙ, yₙ)
```

**Trapezoidal Method (Second-order):**
```
yₙ₊₁ = yₙ + (h/2) × [f(tₙ, yₙ) + f(tₙ₊₁, yₙ₊₁)]
```

#### 4.2.2 Implicit Nature and Fixed-Point Iteration

Since `yₙ₊₁` appears on both sides, we need an iterative approach:

1. **Initial guess**: Use Euler's method for first approximation
   ```
   y⁽⁰⁾ₙ₊₁ = yₙ + h × f(tₙ, yₙ)
   ```

2. **Iteration**: Refine the estimate
   ```
   y⁽ᵏ⁺¹⁾ₙ₊₁ = yₙ + (h/2) × [f(tₙ, yₙ) + f(tₙ₊₁, y⁽ᵏ⁾ₙ₊₁)]
   ```

3. **Convergence check**: Continue until
   ```
   ||y⁽ᵏ⁺¹⁾ₙ₊₁ - y⁽ᵏ⁾ₙ₊₁|| < tolerance
   ```

#### 4.2.3 Implementation Parameters

- **Time step**: h = 0.2 (chosen to balance accuracy and efficiency)
- **Tolerance**: 10⁻⁶ (ensures sufficient precision)
- **Maximum iterations**: 100 per time step (prevents infinite loops)

#### 4.2.4 Performance Analysis

**Computational Efficiency:**
- More function evaluations than explicit methods
- Fewer evaluations than higher-order implicit methods
- Good compromise between accuracy and speed

**Stability Properties:**
- A-stable (unconditionally stable for linear problems)
- Better stability than explicit methods for our nonlinear system
- Can handle moderate stiffness

### 4.3 Radau Method Implementation

#### 4.3.1 Why Radau for Stiff Systems?

The Radau IIA method is particularly well-suited for stiff ODEs because it possesses **L-stability**:
- **A-stability**: Stable for all step sizes in the left half-plane
- **L-stability**: Damping at infinity (handles very stiff components)
- **High order**: Fifth-order accuracy with three stages

#### 4.3.2 Radau IIA Formulation

The method uses three stages with specific coefficients from the Butcher tableau:

```
Stage equations:
Y₁ = yₙ + h × Σ(a₁ⱼ × f(tₙ + cⱼh, Yⱼ))
Y₂ = yₙ + h × Σ(a₂ⱼ × f(tₙ + cⱼh, Yⱼ))  
Y₃ = yₙ + h × Σ(a₃ⱼ × f(tₙ + cⱼh, Yⱼ))

Final update:
yₙ₊₁ = yₙ + h × Σ(bⱼ × f(tₙ + cⱼh, Yⱼ))
```

#### 4.3.3 Newton-Raphson Solution

Since the stages are coupled, we solve the nonlinear system using Newton's method:

1. **Linearization**: Compute Jacobian matrix
2. **Linear solve**: Find correction vector
3. **Update**: Apply correction to stage values
4. **Iterate**: Until convergence

#### 4.3.4 Adaptive Step Size Control

The method includes error estimation and step size adaptation:

```
Error estimate: ||yₙ₊₁⁽⁵⁾ - yₙ₊₁⁽⁴⁾||

New step size: hₙₑw = h × (tolerance/error)^(1/5)
```

#### 4.3.5 Performance Characteristics

**Advantages:**
- Excellent stability for stiff problems
- High accuracy (fifth-order)
- Robust error control
- Proven performance on biological systems

**Computational Cost:**
- Higher cost per step due to Newton iterations
- Offset by ability to take larger steps
- Most efficient for truly stiff problems

# 🧠 Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Stem Cell Dynamics

## 🎯 Core Concept

**Traditional vs. PINN Approach**

## 🏗️ Architecture Design

### Network Structure
Our PINN takes time `t` as input and outputs stem cell populations `[G(t), P(t)]`:

```
Input: t (time) → Neural Network → Output: [G(t), P(t)]
```

**Case-Specific Architectures:**

| Case | Architecture | Parameters | Rationale |
|------|-------------|------------|-----------|
| **Case 1** (Symmetric) | `[128, 128, 64]` | ~25K | Simpler dynamics, less complexity needed |

## 📊 Multi-Objective Loss Function

The PINN learns by minimizing a composite loss:

```
𝐋_total = w_physics × 𝐋_physics + w_initial × 𝐋_initial
```

### 🔬 Physics Loss
Ensures the neural network satisfies our ODE system:

For each time point `t_i`:
1. **Forward pass**: Compute `G(t_i)` and `P(t_i)`
2. **Auto-differentiation**: Calculate `dG/dt` and `dP/dt`
3. **Residual computation**: Check how well the ODE is satisfied

**Residual Equations:**
```
R_G = dG/dt - [Growth_term + Interaction_term - Decay_term]
R_P = dP/dt - [Growth_term + Interaction_term - Decay_term]
```

**Physics Loss:** `𝐋_physics = mean(R_G² + R_P²)`

### 🎯 Initial Condition Loss
Enforces proper starting conditions:
```
𝐋_initial = (G(0) - G₀)² + (P(0) - P₀)²
```
